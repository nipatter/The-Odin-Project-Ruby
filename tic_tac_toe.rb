ABOUT
My implementation of the 2-player game tic-tac-toe.

ALGORITHM/TODO
https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/
has a little more code than a basic tutorial
=end

class Cell
  # Keeps track of a cell's status (blank("")/X/O)
  # A cell's status cannot be updated after being initialized
  #   blank shouldn't be needed but its good to have a default
end

class Board
  # Manage the game grid by getting and setting grid values
  # Use nested Arrays to build the game grid
  # Use a coordinate system (x, y) to access elements (grid positions)
  # The default grid should be a private method
  # 
end

class Array
  # some new methods to deal with the board
end

class Player
  # Keeps track of a player's name and team (X/O)
  # Should use a Hash to do this player => team
  # Handle error if invalid Hash
end

class Game
end
