ABOUT
Implement a method #substrings that takes:
  arg1: a word
  arg2: an array of substrings
and returns a hash listing each substring found in the word
and how many times it was found.
You don't need to worry about case sensitivity,
but you do need to handle multiple words in a sentence

ALGORITHM
1. [OK] Create a list of substring words (use default from TOP)
2. [OK] Split the sentence into words
3. [OK] Create an empty dictionary to store the results 
4. [OK] Check if the word exists in substring list
    [OK] Check for the subwords as well
5. [OK] If it does create a new key in the dictionary or
    [OK] if the key exists then increment the value by 1
6. [OK] Print the hash

dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy",
  "it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

def substrings(sentence, keywords)
  tracker = Hash.new

  words = sentence.downcase.split(" ")
  keywords.each { |key| 
    words.each { |word|
      if word.include? key
        tracker.include?(key) ? tracker[key] += 1 : tracker[key] = 1
      end
    }
  }
  tracker 
end

puts substrings("Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going?", dictionary)
